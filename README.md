# Power-Bi-project
An interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze electric vehicle (EV) data.

Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling, Data Visualization.

Project Overview:
Developed an interactive Power BI report to analyze the electric vehicle (EV) landscape, focusing on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The dashboard provided business insights through key performance indicators (KPIs) related to vehicle distribution, electric range, and market composition.

Key Responsibilities & Achievements:
	• Designed and implemented a data model to support dynamic filtering and analysis of EV-related metrics.
	• Developed KPIs including Total Vehicles, Average Electric Range, Total BEV and PHEV Vehicles, and their respective percentages of total EVs.
	• Utilized DAX measures to compute insights such as:
		○ Average electric range to reflect technological advancements.
		○ BEV and PHEV distribution to understand market trends and growth.
	• Created visually engaging and interactive reports using bar charts, pie charts, and KPI cards to enable quick, data-driven decision-making.
	• Ensured report usability by incorporating slicers and filters for user-driven exploration by vehicle type, year, or model.
Delivered insights that highlight the growing dominance of BEVs over PHEVs in the EV market.
